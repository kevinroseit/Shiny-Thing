Hello, welcome and g'day!

Today we have a delicious multi threading program utilizing Posix.  This code should be pretty portable using threads and multiple muti (mutex's?). 

The main idea for the program is this..

main waits till i = 10 then quits

There are two threads that loop simultaneously one adds 1 to i and another adds 3 to i.

It works.. about as well as a rusty pair of pliers, waiting for a nice lube job.
